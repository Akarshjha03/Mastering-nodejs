11.Mongodb/           # MongoDB integration
12.MVC/               # MVC architecture in Node.js
```

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/Akarshjha03/Mastering-nodejs.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to a topic folder:**
   ```powershell
   cd Mastering-nodejs/1.HelloWorld
   ```
3. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the example:**
   ```powershell
   node hello.js
   ```

## Folder Overview
Each folder contains:
- Example code files (`.js`)
- `package.json` for dependencies
- Topic-specific notes and documentation (`Readme.md`, `.txt`)
- Data/mock files for practice

Refer to each folder's `Readme.md` for details and instructions.

## How to Run Examples
- Open the folder for the topic you want to learn.
- Install dependencies using `npm install` if required.
- Run the main file using `node <filename>.js`.
- Review notes and documentation for explanations.

## Learning Path
1. **Start with `1.HelloWorld`** to understand basic Node.js execution.
2. **Progress through each folder** in order for a structured learning experience.
3. **Practice and experiment** with code and notes provided.
4. **Explore advanced topics** like Express, REST APIs, MongoDB, and MVC.
